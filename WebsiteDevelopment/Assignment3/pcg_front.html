      <h3>Local Woman Wins Marathon</h3>
      <img class="story-woman" src="blake.jpg" alt="lady" />
      <p>
        Estes Park native Laura Blake won the 27th Front Range Marathon over an
        elite field of the best long-distance runners in the country. Laura's
        time of 2 hr. 28 min. 21 sec. was only 2 minutes off the women's course
        record set last year by Sarah Rawlings. Kathy Lasker and Lisa Peterson
        finished second and third, respectively. Laura's victory came on the
        heels of her performance at the NCAA Track and Field Championships, in
        which she placed second running for Colorado State.

      <p>
        In an exciting race, Peter Teagan of San Antonio, Texas, used a
        finishing kick to win the men's marathon for the second straight year,
        in a time of 2 hr. 12 min. 34 sec. Ahead for much of the race, Kyle
        Wills of Billings, Montana, finished second when he could not match
        Teagan's finishing pace. Jason Wu of Boulder, Colorado, placed third in
        a very competitive field. This year's race through downtown Boulder
        boasted the largest field in the marathon's history, with over 9500 men
        and 6700 women competing. Race conditions were perfect with low humidity
        and temperatures that never exceeded 85 degrees.

      <h3>Highway 7 Reopens</h3>
      <p>
        Highway 7 will reopen this Friday, June 3rd, after a final safety
        inspection. A late blizzard delayed road crews, marking this as one of
        the latest dates on record for the highway's reopening. Rising to an
        elevation of over 12,000 feet, Highway 7 is a main link between Estes
        Park and Grand Lake. The reopening of the road is one of the annual
        signs that summer is near and the tourist season will soon be upon us!

      <h3>Cougar Sightings Increase</h3>
      <img src="cougar.jpg" alt="cougar" class="story-cougar1" />
      <img src="becareful.jpg" alt="warning" class="story-cougar2" />
      <p>
        Cougar sightings have increased 40% in the Este Park area according to a
        report released yesterday by the state DNR. In the last month alone,
        there were ten sightings in Estes Park and the surrounding communities
        of Grand Lake and Pinewood Springs. This compares to only twelve
        sightings for the entire spring of last year. Reasons for the growing
        number of cougar sightings include increasing encroachment by people
        into former wildlife habitats and new wildlife regulations that result
        in decreasing numbers of elk and deer being taken by hunters. Cougars
        may be wandering into developed areas, following the herds. DNR
        spokesman Steve Tasker asks residents to call the DNR report line at
        555-6981 if they believe they have seen a cougar or any large predatory
        animal. Two fatalities have already occurred in the west this year from
        cougar attacks.

      <h3>If You Encounter a Cougar</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Stop, stand tall, and don't run. A cougar's instinct is to chase.
        </li>
        <li>Try to appear larger than the cougar by raising your arms.</li>
        <li>Back away slowly, always keeping eye contact.</li>
        <li>
          If the cougar displays aggressive behavior, shout and wave your arms.
          Convince the cougar that you are not prey, but a potential danger.
        </li>
        <li>
          In case of an attack, stay on your feet and fight back aggressively.
        </li>
