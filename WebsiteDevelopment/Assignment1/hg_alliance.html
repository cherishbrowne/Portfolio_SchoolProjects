                <p>
                    Alliance challenges you and your opponents to decide 
                    the outcome. As one of the world powers 
                    battling for supremacy you must lead your country's
                    military drive; but you can't do it alone. 
                    You have to form alliances and then betray your 
                    allies before they betray you!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Decide where to strike, when to strike, and the intensity
                    of the strike. Will it be a bombing 
                raid, an offshore missile barrage, or an invasion 
                with land forces and tanks? Plan your attack, 
                move into enemy territory with your forces and win 
                the conflict.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The economic destiny of your nation is also at stake. 
                    Buy armaments and develop secret 
                    weapons from your country's economic funds and 
                    natural reserves, but be sure to save 
                    something for the future.

                        The list of war simulation games is long. All of them 
                        share similar features including the 
                        formation of temporary Alliance and battles simulated 
                        through random draws of a deck or the 
                        roll of the die. Alliance offers very little that 
                        is new or innovative in that regard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We found the game to be too drawn-out and confusing. 
                        In fact, I dare say we spent more time 
                        reading and rereading the rule book than actually 
                        playing the game. If you want to read a 
                        book on war, we suggest Sun Tzu.

                <h2>Decent Game but Many are Better</h2>
                <hr>

                    <p>
                        Alliance is a good war simulation game. We found the 
                        game play to be robust and engaging. The 
                        rules are long and drawn out but, for anyone with 
                        experience in this class of board games, there 
                        is little there that's unexpected or difficult. We 
                        think the battle simulation cards are some of 
                        the best we have encountered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alliance is fun game and is sure to appeal to 
                        war game enthusiasts. We think it offers several new 
                        ideas that we're surprised have not been utilized in other simulation games. The card system and the 
                        investment options give the game a "real world" feel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All of that being said, the competition for this type 
                        of game is fierce. There are a lot of 
                        established titles with loyal clients. We're not 
                        exactly sure where Alliance fits in with 
                        that group. It's a good game, but not good enough 
                        to draw our attention away from games like 
                        Battle Tested and Global Conflict.

                    <p>This is a great game for anyone 16 years or older. Younger players may have trouble with the rules and may be bored</p>
